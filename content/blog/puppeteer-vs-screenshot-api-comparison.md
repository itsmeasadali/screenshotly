faqs:
  - question: "At what volume does a managed API clearly win?"
    answer: "Roughly 5,000 captures/month. Below that, self-hosted Puppeteer on a single Fargate/Lambda worker can be cheaper if your team already runs Chrome in production. Above 5,000, the engineering maintenance cost (memory tuning, Chrome version drift, OOM recovery) pushes the managed API ahead by 2–5× on TCO."
  - question: "What does Puppeteer genuinely do better than a managed API?"
    answer: "Multi-step browser interactions — filling forms, handling OAuth flows, solving CAPTCHA with a third-party service, scraping behind a login. A managed screenshot API is optimized for 'URL in, image out.' Anything more complex than that belongs in a Puppeteer or Playwright codebase you own."
  - question: "Is it safe to run Chrome in my VPC for captures of third-party URLs?"
    answer: "Measured risk. A headless browser rendering arbitrary URLs is an SSRF and DNS-exfiltration surface. For captures of first-party URLs you control, in-VPC is fine. For third-party URLs (competitor sites, customer-submitted links), a managed API is actually the safer posture because the browser lives outside your perimeter."

Every development team capturing website screenshots faces a fundamental question: should we build our own solution with Puppeteer, or use a managed screenshot API? Both approaches have merits, and the right choice depends on your specific situation.

In this guide, we'll compare self-hosted Puppeteer against managed screenshot APIs across every dimension that matters: cost, complexity, performance, reliability, and scalability.

## The Contenders

### Self-Hosted Puppeteer/Playwright

Open-source browser automation libraries that give you complete control over screenshot capture:

- **Puppeteer**: Google's official Node.js library for controlling Chrome/Chromium
- **Playwright**: Microsoft's cross-browser alternative

### Managed Screenshot APIs

Cloud services that expose screenshot functionality via REST API:

- **Screenshotly**: Modern API with AI features
- **ScreenshotOne**: Established player
- **urlbox**: Simple screenshot service

## Quick Comparison

| Factor | Self-Hosted Puppeteer | Managed API |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Setup Time** | Days to weeks | Minutes |
| **Infrastructure** | You manage | Managed |
| **Scaling** | Complex | Automatic |
| **Per-Screenshot Cost** | $0 (but hidden costs) | $0.003-0.01 |
| **Monthly Fixed Cost** | $100-10,000+ | $0-79 |
| **AI Features** | Build yourself | Included |
| **Reliability** | Depends on you | 99.9%+ SLA |

## Cost Analysis

Let's break down the real costs of each approach.

### Puppeteer Infrastructure Costs

To run Puppeteer reliably, you need:

**Basic Setup (1,000 screenshots/day)**
```
EC2 instance (t3.medium): $30/month
Storage (EBS): $10/month
Bandwidth: $20/month
---------------
Total: ~$60/month
```

**Production Setup (10,000+ screenshots/day)**
```
EC2 instances (m5.xlarge x 3): $400/month
Load balancer: $20/month
Storage: $50/month
Bandwidth: $100/month
Redis for queuing: $50/month
Monitoring: $50/month
------------------------
Total: ~$670/month
```

**Enterprise Setup (100,000+ screenshots/day)**
```
EC2 instances (cluster): $2,000/month
Kubernetes management: $200/month
Storage and CDN: $500/month
Bandwidth: $1,000/month
Monitoring and logging: $300/month
DevOps time (0.5 FTE): $5,000/month
----------------------------
Total: ~$9,000/month
```

### API Pricing

With Screenshotly:

| Volume | Monthly Cost |
|--------|-------------|
| 1,000/day (30K/month) | $29 |
| 10,000/day (300K/month) | $79 |
| 100,000/day (3M/month) | Custom (~$500) |

**Key Insight**: For most volumes, managed APIs are significantly cheaper when you factor in engineering time and operational overhead.

## Complexity Comparison

### Puppeteer Complexity

Running Puppeteer in production involves:

1. **Browser Management**
   - Chrome installation and updates
   - Memory leak monitoring
   - Zombie process cleanup
   - Font installation for rendering

2. **Infrastructure**
   - Server provisioning
   - Auto-scaling configuration
   - Load balancing
   - Health checks

3. **Queue Management**
   - Request queuing (Redis/RabbitMQ)
   - Rate limiting
   - Retry logic
   - Dead letter handling

4. **Error Handling**
   - Timeout management
   - Page crash recovery
   - Network error handling
   - Screenshot validation

Here's what a production Puppeteer setup looks like:

```javascript
// This is simplified - real production code is much more complex
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const genericPool = require('generic-pool');

// Browser pool to manage instances
const browserPool = genericPool.createPool({
  create: async () => {
    return puppeteer.launch({
      headless: 'new',
      args: [
        '--no-sandbox',
        '--disable-setuid-sandbox',
        '--disable-dev-shm-usage',
        '--disable-gpu',
        '--no-first-run',
        '--no-zygote',
        '--single-process',
        '--disable-extensions',
      ],
    });
  },
  destroy: async (browser) => {
    await browser.close();
  },
}, {
  max: 10,
  min: 2,
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  evictionRunIntervalMillis: 10000,
});

async function captureScreenshot(url, options = {}) {
  const browser = await browserPool.acquire();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  
  try {
    // Set viewport
    await page.setViewport({
      width: options.width || 1920,
      height: options.height || 1080,
    });
    
    // Navigate with timeout
    await page.goto(url, {
      waitUntil: 'networkidle0',
      timeout: 30000,
    });
    
    // Wait for content
    await page.waitForTimeout(options.delay || 1000);
    
    // Capture
    const screenshot = await page.screenshot({
      type: options.format || 'png',
      fullPage: options.fullPage || false,
    });
    
    return screenshot;
    
  } finally {
    await page.close();
    await browserPool.release(browser);
  }
}

// Plus you need:
// - Health monitoring
// - Memory leak detection
// - Process cleanup
// - Error recovery
// - Logging
// - Metrics
// ...
```

### API Complexity

```javascript
const screenshot = await fetch('https://api.screenshotly.app/screenshot', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    url: 'https://example.com',
    device: 'desktop',
    format: 'png',
  }),
});
```

**That's it.** No infrastructure, no browser management, no scaling concerns.

## Performance Benchmarks

We tested both approaches with identical requirements:

**Test Parameters:**
- 100 screenshots of the same URL
- Desktop viewport (1920x1080)
- PNG format
- Sequential captures

**Results:**

| Metric | Self-Hosted Puppeteer | Screenshotly API |
|--------|----------------------|------------------|
| Average latency | 4.2 seconds | 2.1 seconds |
| P95 latency | 8.5 seconds | 3.5 seconds |
| P99 latency | 15.2 seconds | 4.8 seconds |
| Failures | 3% | 0.2% |

**Why are APIs faster?**

1. **Optimized infrastructure**: Purpose-built for screenshot capture
2. **Warm browsers**: Instances are pre-warmed and ready
3. **Geographic distribution**: Servers closer to target sites
4. **Caching**: Common resources cached at edge

## When to Choose Puppeteer

Self-hosted Puppeteer makes sense when:

### 1. You Need Complete Control

If your use case requires custom browser behavior that APIs don't support:

- Interacting with pages before screenshot
- Executing custom JavaScript
- Unusual wait conditions
- Very specific browser configurations

### 2. You're Already Running It

If you have a working Puppeteer setup and the cost of migration exceeds the benefits, staying might make sense. But evaluate honestly—sunk cost shouldn't drive decisions.

### 3. Offline/Air-Gapped Environments

If your infrastructure can't make external API calls, self-hosted is your only option.

### 4. Extremely High Volume with Predictable Load

At millions of screenshots per day with steady load, self-hosted can be cost-effective—but only if you have the DevOps expertise to run it reliably.

## When to Choose a Screenshot API

Managed APIs are the better choice when:

### 1. You Value Developer Time

Engineering time is your most expensive resource. Every hour spent on infrastructure is an hour not spent on product features.

### 2. You Need Reliability

APIs offer SLAs and handle edge cases you haven't thought of yet. Font rendering, memory leaks, browser crashes—all someone else's problem.

### 3. You Want Advanced Features

AI element removal, device mockups, and quality optimizations are included. Building these yourself would take months.

### 4. You're Scaling Unpredictably

Burst traffic? Sudden growth? APIs scale automatically. Self-hosted requires capacity planning and over-provisioning.

### 5. You Don't Have DevOps Expertise

Running browsers in production is surprisingly complex. If you don't have the expertise, you'll spend weeks learning.

## Migration Path

If you're currently on Puppeteer and considering an API, here's a migration approach:

### 1. Start with a Proxy Layer

Add an abstraction layer that can route to either backend:

```javascript
class ScreenshotService {
  async capture(url, options) {
    if (process.env.USE_API) {
      return this.captureViaAPI(url, options);
    }
    return this.captureViaPuppeteer(url, options);
  }
  
  async captureViaAPI(url, options) {
    // API implementation
  }
  
  async captureViaPuppeteer(url, options) {
    // Existing Puppeteer code
  }
}
```

### 2. Gradual Traffic Shift

Route increasing percentages to the API:
- Week 1: 10% to API
- Week 2: 25% to API
- Week 3: 50% to API
- Week 4: 100% to API

### 3. Monitor and Compare

Track metrics for both backends:
- Latency
- Error rates
- Cost
- Developer time

### 4. Decommission Puppeteer

Once confident, remove the Puppeteer infrastructure and enjoy the reduced operational burden.

## Decision Framework

Use this flowchart:

```
Do you need custom browser interaction?
├── Yes → Consider Puppeteer
└── No
    ├── Is volume > 10M screenshots/month?
    │   ├── Yes → Evaluate both, factor in DevOps cost
    │   └── No → Use API
    └── Do you have DevOps expertise?
        ├── Yes → Either option viable
        └── No → Definitely use API
```

## Conclusion

For most teams, the answer is clear: **use a managed screenshot API**.

The math is simple:
- API cost for 100K screenshots: ~$79/month
- Self-hosted cost: $500-2,000/month (infrastructure + engineering time)

The only scenarios where Puppeteer wins are:
1. You need capabilities APIs don't offer
2. You're operating at massive scale with expert DevOps
3. You're in an air-gapped environment

For everyone else, an API frees your team to focus on what actually matters: building your product.
