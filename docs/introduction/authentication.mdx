# Authentication

Screenshotly uses API tokens for authentication. Each request to the API must include your token in the Authorization header.

## Getting Your API Token

1. Sign in to your [Screenshotly Dashboard](https://screenshotly.app/dashboard)
2. Navigate to the [API Tokens](https://screenshotly.app/dashboard/tokens) page
3. Click "Generate New Token"
4. Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "Development", "Production")
5. Copy your token immediately - you won't be able to see it again!

## Using Your Token

Include your API token in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` scheme:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

Example request:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.screenshotly.app/screenshot \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com"
  }'
```

```typescript TypeScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.screenshotly.app/screenshot', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_TOKEN}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    url: 'https://example.com',
  }),
});
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'https://api.screenshotly.app/screenshot',
    headers={
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_TOKEN}',
    },
    json={
        'url': 'https://example.com',
    },
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Token Security

Follow these best practices to keep your tokens secure:

- Never share your API tokens or commit them to version control
- Use different tokens for development and production environments
- Set appropriate expiration dates for your tokens
- Store tokens securely in environment variables
- Revoke compromised tokens immediately through the dashboard

## Rate Limits

Rate limits are applied per token and vary by plan:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Free" icon="sparkles">
    * 500 requests per day
    * 2 concurrent requests
    * 10MB max file size
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pro" icon="rocket">
    * 5,000 requests per day
    * 5 concurrent requests
    * 20MB max file size
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Rate Limit Headers

The API includes rate limit information in the response headers:

```bash
X-RateLimit-Limit: 500
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 495
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1635724800
```

### Rate Limit Errors

When you exceed your rate limit, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "reset": 1635724800
}
```

## Token Management

Manage your tokens through the [dashboard](https://screenshotly.app/dashboard/tokens):

- Generate new tokens
- View active tokens
- Monitor token usage
- Revoke tokens
- Set expiration dates
